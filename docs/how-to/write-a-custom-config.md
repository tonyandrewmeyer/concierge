    description: How to adapt a built-in Concierge preset into a custom concierge.yaml — adding snaps, changing the Juju version, disabling providers, or adding new ones.

# Write a custom config

When the built-in [presets](../reference/presets) don't fit your needs, write
your own YAML configuration file and point Concierge at it:

```bash
sudo concierge prepare -c path/to/your-config.yaml
```

If you name the file `concierge.yaml` and run `sudo concierge prepare` from
its directory with no `-p` or `-c`, Concierge will pick it up automatically.

The best starting point is the preset that most closely matches what you want.

## Start from a preset

Open the [presets reference page](../reference/presets), find the preset that
most closely matches what you want, and copy its YAML into a local file — for
example, `concierge.yaml`. Edit it to suit your needs, then run:

```bash
sudo concierge prepare -c concierge.yaml
```

## Common adaptations

### Add or remove a snap

Snaps live under `host.snaps` as a map keyed by snap name. Add an entry to
install a snap; remove one to skip it. Add a `channel:` if you need a specific
track. Adapted from `dev.yaml`:

```yaml
host:
  snaps:
    charmcraft:
    jq:
    astral-uv:
      channel: latest/beta
```

### Change the Juju version

Set `juju.channel`, and optionally pin an `agent-version`:

```yaml
juju:
  channel: 3.6/stable
  agent-version: "3.6.11"
```

### Turn off Kubernetes

Start from `dev.yaml` and either delete the `k8s:` block from `providers:`
or disable it explicitly:

```yaml
providers:
  k8s:
    enable: false
```

### Add a provider that presets don't cover

To add a Google cloud provider on top of an existing preset, extend the
`providers:` block and provide credentials — see
[Provide cloud credentials](provide-credentials):

```yaml
providers:
  google:
    enable: true
    bootstrap: true
    credentials-file: /home/ubuntu/google-credentials.yaml
```
