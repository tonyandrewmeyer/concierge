# Concierge

Concierge is an opinionated utility for provisioning charm development and
testing machines. It installs the "craft" tools and providers you need,
bootstraps a Juju controller onto each provider, and installs supporting
packages from the snap store or the Ubuntu archive.

Concierge is fully declarative: a single `concierge prepare` command takes a
machine from a fresh install to a ready environment, and `concierge restore`
reverses it.
