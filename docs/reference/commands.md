# Commands

Concierge has three primary commands: `prepare`, `restore`, and `status`.

## Global flags

The following flags apply to every command.

| Flag              | Description                     |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `-v, --verbose`   | Enable verbose logging.         |
| `--trace`         | Enable trace logging.           |
| `-h, --help`      | Show help for the command.      |
| `--version`       | Print the Concierge version.    |

## `concierge prepare`

Provision the machine according to the configuration.

```
concierge prepare [flags]
```

Concierge selects its configuration in this order:

1. `-c, --config <path>` — an explicit config file.
2. `-p, --preset <name>` — one of the built-in [presets](presets).
3. A `concierge.yaml` file in the current working directory.

| `--extra-debs <list>`      | Additional apt packages to install (comma-separated).                |

## `concierge restore`

Run the reverse of `concierge prepare`, removing everything Concierge would
have installed.

```
concierge restore [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag        | Description                                       |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `--dry-run` | Print the commands that would run without executing them. |

:::{important}
Restore removes everything Concierge would install, regardless of whether it
was on the machine beforehand. See the [explanation of prepare and
restore](../explanation/prepare-and-restore) for the reasoning.
:::

## `concierge status`

Report the status of Concierge on the machine — which providers are up, which
Juju controllers are bootstrapped, and which snaps and packages are installed.
Must be run as root.

```
sudo concierge status
```
