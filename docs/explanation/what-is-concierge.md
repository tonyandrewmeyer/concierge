# What Concierge is for

Charm development needs a familiar-looking machine: the right craft tools
(`charmcraft`, `snapcraft`, `rockcraft`), the right providers (LXD,
Kubernetes), and a Juju controller bootstrapped and ready to use. Getting a
machine into that shape by hand takes many commands and a lot of tacit
knowledge, and every developer's machine ends up subtly different.

Concierge exists to make that setup **declarative** and **reproducible**.
You describe the machine you want in a YAML file — or pick one of the
[built-in presets](../reference/presets) — and Concierge does the work.

## What Concierge is not

Concierge is a **provisioner**, not a runtime. Once it has prepared a machine,
you interact with the tools it installed (Juju, Charmcraft, snapd, …)
directly. Concierge doesn't sit in the loop.

Concierge is also not a **charm-development tutorial**. It gets you a machine
that is ready to develop charms; learning how to develop charms happens
elsewhere (see the [Ops
documentation](https://canonical.com/juju/docs/ops/latest/) for that).

## Why declarative

A `concierge.yaml` file captures exactly what a machine needs to be a
charm-development environment, in a form that can be committed to version
control, diffed, and shared between developers and CI. Two developers using
the same config get the same setup; a CI job using that config gets the same
setup as a developer's laptop.

## `prepare` and `restore` are opposites, not deltas

Concierge has two mirror-image commands: `prepare` provisions the machine
according to your configuration; `restore` undoes what `prepare` did.

`concierge restore` does not observe the machine and revert changes it can
detect. It computes what `prepare` **would install** from the same
configuration, and removes exactly that set. This makes restore predictable
and cheap, but it has a consequence:

:::{warning}
If the machine already had one of Concierge's snaps, packages, or
configuration files before you ran `prepare`, `restore` will remove it
anyway.
:::

The alternative — a restore that tries to preserve pre-existing state — would
need to snapshot every changed file, every installed package, and every Juju
controller before touching them, and remember which of them existed
beforehand. That's a substantial amount of machinery to build and maintain,
and it hides bugs when the snapshot and reality drift apart.

## Where Concierge fits

Because restore is all-or-nothing, Concierge is intended for **throwaway**
machines — VMs, CI runners, dedicated test hosts — not for the workstation you
use for everything else. That constraint is also what makes Concierge a
natural fit for CI pipelines, which need to leave the runner in a clean state
between jobs.
