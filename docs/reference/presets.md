# Presets

Concierge ships with several built-in presets that cover common charm
development setups. Choose one with `-p / --preset`:

```bash
sudo concierge prepare -p dev
```

| Preset     | Included                                                                             |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `crafts`   | `lxd`, `snapcraft`, `charmcraft`, `rockcraft`                                        |
| `dev`      | `juju`, `k8s`, `lxd`, `snapcraft`, `charmcraft`, `rockcraft`, `jhack`, `astral-uv`   |
| `k8s`      | `juju`, `k8s`, `lxd`, `rockcraft`, `charmcraft`                                      |
| `microk8s` | `juju`, `microk8s`, `lxd`, `rockcraft`, `charmcraft`                                 |
| `machine`  | `juju`, `lxd`, `snapcraft`, `charmcraft`                                             |

In the `k8s` and `microk8s` presets, LXD is installed but not bootstrapped —
it is present only so Charmcraft can use it as a build backend.

To adapt one of these presets into your own config, see
[Write a custom config](../how-to/write-a-custom-config).
